# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Navigation links and assets were using absolute paths (`/about.html`, `/assets/...`) which work locally but break on GitHub Pages because the site is served from a subdirectory (`https://matthew-thaokhamlue.github.io/TPEC/`).

**Solution**: Changed all absolute paths to relative paths (`./about.html`, `./assets/...`) to work correctly with GitHub Pages subdirectory structure.
