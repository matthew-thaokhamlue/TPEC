## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Cascading Image Loading Disaster** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The `assets/img/placeholder-project.jpg` file was a text file, not an image, causing hundreds of cascading 404 errors on the projects page.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the problematic placeholder file
- Updated performance.css to remove placeholder references
- Simplified image error handling across all JS files

**Impact:** Projects page now loads cleanly without console spam

### 2. **Team Member Display Issue** (HIGH)
**Problem:** Only 1 team member showing instead of all 3 on about.html

**Solution:**
- Fixed main.js renderLeadershipTeam() function
- Implemented robust team initialization system
- Added protection against script conflicts

**Impact:** All 3 team members now display correctly:
- Mr. Bounlieng Thephachanh (Founder & Managing Director)
- Ms. Sengdavanh Thepphachanh (Vice President)
- Mr. Matthew Thaokhamlue (Technology Advisor)

### 3. **Image Error Handling Optimization** (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** Multiple conflicting image fallback systems causing performance issues

**Solution:**
- Simplified error handling in image-optimizer.js
- Removed cascading fallback attempts
- Implemented graceful image hiding instead of placeholder loading

**Impact:** Clean image error handling without performance penalties
